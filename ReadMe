IsoTONE is a WORK IN PROGRESS - do not expect it to run smoothly!
If you wish to use IsoTONE, please don't hesitate to contact me: eliza.harris@sdsc.ethz.ch

If you want to try IsoTONE:
- Create environment from the .yml file
- Run 1_* to get inputs for the model
- Run 2_* to load the core function to solve soil d15N
- Run 3_* carefully (look through the code step by step!) to run the MCMC and generate results in the folder MCMC_results
- Once you have MCMC results, run 4_* to look at the results
